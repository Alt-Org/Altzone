# Writing documentation pages {#page-documentation-pages}
Doxygen can create custom pages. They can be used to list information that is useful to those reading the documentation, such as this page.  
Subpages allow for segmenting the information of a page to make it easier to navigate and read.  
See [Doxygen documentationðŸ¡µ](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/additional.html#custom_pages).

<br/>

## File guidelines {#page-documentation-pages-file}
Page files are `.md` Markdown files that are found in @dirref{Altzone/Doc/Doxygen/Battle/additional-documentation/pages}.  
Page files should be named with a number and the name of the page. The number defines the order of the pages as they appear on the documentation webpage. File names should be all lower case and words should be separated by hyphens.  
`(number)-(page-name).md`  
Subpages should be named with the name of the parent page file followed by the name of the subpage. File names should be all lower case and words should be separated by hyphens.  
`(number)-(page-name)-(subpage-name).md`  

Documentation text inside these files is written without the use of documentation comments.

<br/>

### Unicode characters {#page-documentation-pages-file-unicode}
Unicode characters are ok to use inside of documentation page files.

<br/>

### Documentation commands {#page-documentation-pages-commands}
Doxygen supports various commands that can be used in page documentation. See [Documenting with Doxygen](#page-documentation-doxygen) for more information on these.  
All commands are allowed in documentation page files, so you should choose the most appropriate format.

<br/>

### Linking formats {#page-documentation-pages-linking}
Doxygen supports various types of linking formats. See [Linking styles and formats](#page-documentation-doxygen-styles-formats) for more information on these.  
Markdown links are preferred in documentation pages. Custom links are also preferred when appropriate.  
Markdown reference link definitions should be placed at the end of the file.

<br/>

### Markdown {#page-documentation-pages-markdown}
Markdown formatting is preferred in documentation pages. See [Doxygen documentationðŸ¡µ](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/markdown.html).  
When writing text, line breaks should be done using two spaces at the end of the line.  
Sections should be separated by a line break using `<br/>`.  
Sections that fit together should be grouped using `---` to create lines on the page.

### Titles

Mainpage
- Mainpage is a special case with no title or ID. It is defined with the `@mainpage` [Doxygen commandðŸ¡µ](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdmainpage).

Page titles
- The first thing on a page should be the title, defined with a Markdown header followed by the page ID as such:  
  `# (Page name) {(#page-ID)}`

Page IDs
- Page IDs should start with the word page, followed by the name of the page. IDs should be all lower case and words should be separated by hyphens.  
  `#page-(page-name)`

Subpage IDs
- Subpage IDs start with the ID of the parent page they are under, followed by the name of the subpage. Follow the same formatting rules as page IDs.  
  `#page-(page-name)-(subpage-name)`

<br/>

### Sections
Documentation pages should be split into sections in a tree format. All pages and sections must have IDs.  

Section titles  
- Sections are defined with a Markdown header followed by the section ID as such:  
  `## (Section name) {(#section-ID)}`

Mainpage section IDs
- Mainpage sections are a special case. The section IDs should start with the word index, followed by the name of the section.  
  `#index-(section-name)`

Page section IDs
- Page section IDs start with the ID of the page they are on, followed by the name of the section. Follow the same formatting rules as page IDs.  
  `#page-(page-name)-(section-name)`
