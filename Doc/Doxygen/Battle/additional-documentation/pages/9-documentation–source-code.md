# Documenting Source code {#page-documentation-documenting-source-code}
All aspects of source code, such as files, methods and variables, should be documented with clear and concise information.  
Documentation should be written in documentation comment blocks using the `///` format.  
Different sections of the documentation should be separated by an empty line.   

Refer to the [Documenting Quantum systems](#page-documentation-source-code-quantum-systems) section for additional guidelines if you are documenting a %Quantum system.  
Refer to the [Documenting Unity/View](#page-documentation-source-code-unity-view) section for additional guidelines if you are documenting Unity/View code.

<br/>

## Base guidelines {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines}

<br/>

### Unicode characters {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-unicode}
Unicode characters can not be used inside of source code, even in documentation comments. The use of them can be circumvented with for example custom commands. See [[Circumventing unicode characters]](#page-documentation-doxygen-custom-commands-unicode)

<br/>

### Doxygen specific and non-Doxygen specific {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific}
Some parts of documentation in source code are only read by Doxygen, while others are recognized by the IDE or Unity. This places some limitations on what formats can be used in certain contexts.  
Non-Doxygen specific areas of code documentation:
- Class, method and variable documentation:
  - XML `<summary>` Command
  - XML `<param>` Command
  - XML `<returns>` Command
Doxygen specific areas of code documentation:
- All other areas, such as:
  - File documentation (A `<summary>` section inside a file documentation block is also Doxygen specific)
  - Other areas of class, method and variable documentation

### Documentation commands {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-commands}
Doxygen supports various commands that can be used in source code documentation. See [Documenting with Doxygen](#page-documentation-doxygen) for more information on these.  

Always use these XML Commands when documenting files, classes, methods and variables:
- `<summary>`
- `<param>`
- `<returns>`

In a [Non-Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) part of documentation you should only use XML Commands. When using XML Commands you should consider compatibility with both Doxygen and other tools. With careful consideration other kinds of commands can sometimes be used, as long as they don't cause issues when any tool reads them and don't negatively affect the readibility of the documentation too much. The most important thing is to test compatibility and readability.  

Other kinds of commands can be used if they are in a [Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) part of documentation, such as the file documentation.  
You should still consider consistency. For example even though file documentation is Doxygen specific, `<summary>` should still be used.  

The `<br/>` command should be used for line breaks.  

<br/>

### Linking formats {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-linking}
Doxygen supports various types of linking formats. See [Linking styles and formats](#page-documentation-doxygen-styles-formats) for more information on these.  

In a [Non-Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) part of documentation you should use the XML link format. When using XML links you should consider compatibility with both Doxygen and other tools. With careful consideration other kinds of links can sometimes be used, as long as they don't cause issues when any tool reads them and don't negatively affect the readibility of the documentation too much. The most important thing is to test compatibility and readability.  

In a [Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) part of documentation you can use other link formats, such as Markdown, Doxygen and custom links.  
You should still consider consistency.

<br/>

### Markdown {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-markdown}
Markdown can be used in [Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) contexts when documenting source code, but you should always test to see if it functions as desired.  
With careful consideration Markdown can be used in [Non-Doxygen specific](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-doxygen-specific) contexts, as long as it doesn't cause issues when any tool reads it and doesn't negatively affect the readibility of the documentation too much. The most important thing is to test compatibility and readability.

<br/>

### Documenting C# Files {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-files}
File documentation should have a reference to the file, a summary and possible longer information as its own section.

```
/// @file BattlePlayerMovementController.cs
/// <summary>
/// Handles player input, movement and rotations.
/// </summary>
///
/// Gets player's Quantum.Input and updates player's position and rotation depending on player's actions.
/// Handles moving, rotating and teleporting players and all their hitboxes.
```

<br/>

### Documenting Classes {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-classes}
Classes should be documented with a summary.

```
/// <summary>
/// Handles player input, movement and rotations.
/// </summary>
public static unsafe class BattlePlayerMovementController
```

<br/>

### Documenting Methods {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-methods}
When documenting any method, the different sections of the comment such as the summary, parameters and return value should be separated by an empty line.

```
/// <summary>
/// Clamps the grid position of the player to the playfield of their team.
/// </summary>
///
/// <param name="playerData">Pointer to the player's data component.</param>
/// <param name="gridPosition">The grid position of the player.</param>
/// <param name="clampedPosition">The resulting clamped position of the player.</param>
/// 
/// <returns>True if the position changed from clamping, false if it remained the same.</returns>
```

<br/>

### Documenting public getters {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-public-getters}
The format used for documenting public getters for private variables. Using both summary and value tags so that in doxygen it's clear that it's a getter for another variable, and in code it's clear what it's value is.

```
/// <summary>Public getter for #_rectTransform.</summary>
/// <value>Reference to the %Battle Ui element's <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransform.html">RectTransform@u-exlink</a> component.</value>
public RectTransform RectTransformComponent => _rectTransform;
```

<br/>

### Documenting variables {#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines-variables}
Variables should be documented with a summary.

```
/// <summary>Reference to the %Battle Ui element's <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/RectTransform.html">RectTransform@u-exlink</a> component.</summary>
private RectTransform _rectTransform;
```

## Documenting Unity/View {#page-documentation-source-code-unity-view}
The [base guidelines](#page-documentation-source-code-base-guidelines) apply to Unity/View documentation. Below are additional guidelines for specifically formatting Unity/View documentation.

<br/>

### Documenting SerializeFields {#page-documentation-source-code-unity-view-serializefields}
The format used for grouping SerializeFields. Example provided also has SerializeField summary documentation.
- Anchor name is in format ClassName-SerializeFields.
- Make sure that the header is copied entirely, and the example comments starting with two slashes // are removed.
- Place all SerializeField variables inside the group.
- SerializeField variable documentation should be on a single line, use summary tags and have "[SerializeField] " prefix.

```
/// @anchor BattleUiJoystickHandler-SerializeFields // Anchor name
/// @name SerializeField variables // The group name
/// <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html">SerializeFields@u-exlink</a> are serialized variables exposed to the Unity editor. // Group description
/// @{ // Start of the grouped SerializeFields

/// <summary>[SerializeField] Reference to BattleUiController.</summary> // SerializeField summary documentation
