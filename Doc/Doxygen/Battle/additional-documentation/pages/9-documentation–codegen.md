# Documenting %Quantum generated code {#page-documentation-codegen}
These are guidelines for writing documentation for %Quantum generated code.  

Documentation for %Quantum generated code is written in `.dox` files because it can not be written directly in source code. Documentation is written using documentation comments with the `///` syntax.  
All `.qtn` files created by us should be documented, with a separate `.dox` file for each `.qtn` file.  
The code being documented is that which is found in the generated code resulting from what is defined in the `.qtn` file.  
The generated code is found in the Quantum namespace.  
When referencing code symbols, make sure to reference the correct generated code.  
%Quantum components should be referenced to as structs, as %Quantum generates them as such.

## Base guidelines {#page-documentation-codegen-base-guidelines}

<br/>

### Unicode characters {#page-documentation-codegen-base-guidelines-unicode}
Unicode characters are ok to use inside of `.dox` files.

<br/>

### Documentation commands {#page-documentation-codegen-base-guidelines-commands}
Doxygen supports various commands that can be used when documenting %Quantum generated code. See [[Documenting with Doxygen]](#page-documentation-doxygen-commands) for more information on these.  
All commands are allowed in `.dox` files, so you should choose the most appropriate format.

<br/>

### Linking formats {#page-documentation-codegen-base-guidelines-linking}
Doxygen supports various types of linking formats. See [[Linking styles and formats]](#page-documentation-doxygen-styles-formats) for more information on these.  
Markdown links are preferred. Custom links are also preferred when appropriate.  
Markdown reference link definitions should be placed at the end of the same documentation comment block. They only work within the block they are defined in.

<br/>

### Markdown {#page-documentation-codegen-base-guidelines-markdown}
Markdown formatting can me used in `.dox` files. See [Doxygen documentationðŸ¡µ](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/markdown.html).  
When writing text, line breaks should be done using two spaces at the end of the line.

## File guidelines {#page-documentation-codegen-documenting-file-guidelines}
%Quantum generated code documentation files are `.dox` files found in @dirref{Altzone/Doc/Doxygen/Battle/additional-documentation/quantum-codegen} to not have unnecessary additional files in Unity's @dirref{Altzone,Assets} folder, especially because Unity would create `.meta` files to keep track of the files for no reason.  
The directory structure inside the above directory matches that found in the project.  
The files are named as follows:  
- Filenames begin with "qtn" in all lower case.
- This is then followed by the name of the `.qtn` file being documented as it's named in the project separated by a hyphen.

Example filename:  
`qtn-(ExampleFilename).dox`

<br/>

## Documentation format {#page-documentation-codegen-documenting-format}
The file should be documented with a `@file` command and a [{brief/summary}].  
In the [{detailed description}] of the file documentation all enums and structs defined in the file should be listed.  

Enums and structs should be listed under their own headers as bullet points.   

```
/// @file Filename.qtn
/// <summary>
/// Description
/// </summary>
///
/// ## Generated Enums
/// - @cref{Quantum,EnumName}  
///   @copybrief Quantum.EnumName
///
/// ## Generated Structs
/// - @cref{Quantum,StructName}  
///   @copybrief Quantum.StructName
```

All enums and structs defined in a `.qtn` file should be documented.  

Enums should be documented with a `@enum` command with the name of the enum formatted with `::` as below followed by a [{brief/summary}]. 
Below that a link to the `.qtn` file itself should be listed as below.  
Each variable defined in an enum should be documented with a `@var` command with the name of the enum and the name of the variable followed by a [{brief/summary}].   

```
/// @enum Quantum::EnumName
/// <summary>
/// Description
/// </summary>
///
/// @bigtext{Generated from @ref Filename.qtn}

/// @var Quantum::EnumName Quantum::EnumName::VariableName
/// <summary>Description</summary>
```

Structs should be documented with a `@struct` command with the name of the struct formatted with `::` as below followed by a [{brief/summary}]. 
Below that a link to the `.qtn` file itself should be listed as below.  
Each variable defined in a struct should be documented with a `@var` command with the type of the variable and the name of the variable followed by a [{brief/summary}]. 


```
/// @struct Quantum::StructName
/// <summary>
/// Description
/// </summary>
///
/// @bigtext{Generated from @ref Filename.qtn}

/// @var Type Quantum::StructName::VariableName
/// <summary>Description</summary>
```
